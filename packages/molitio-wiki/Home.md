[Molitio Web Engine](../../README.md)

# Welcome to the Molitio Wiki

## How and why do we use it?

To enhance efficiency and success, it is advisable to establish a framework and document it in a way that is easy to follow and consistent.
  * Primarily for knowledge sharing, with continuous incremental expansion.
  * To document processes and methods, both those yet to be explored and those already tried and tested.
  * For version control and source history, which is useful for ad-hoc tasks.
  * To track time-critical tasks.

## What should you know on this portal?

We record the discussed project concepts, solutions, issues, and milestones in the appropriate places.
  * [Wiki (this page) :)](https://github.com/molitio/molitio-web-engine/blob/main/packages/molitio-wiki/Home.md)

    "Knowledge applied with good intention is wisdom" - the more we document, the more our toolbox expands.
  * [Monorepo for an interconnected web application platfrom](https://github.com/molitio/molitio-web-engine/tree/main/packages/molitio-wiki/development)

    Focusing on one web application platform, all interconnected components and services are in the Web Engine monorepo.
  * [Issues for bugs/tasks/epics](https://github.com/molitio/molitio-web-engine)

    Open Issues on the public side. We have an internal YouTrack for internal development tasks, but we maintain the issues section to be able to recieve feedback.
