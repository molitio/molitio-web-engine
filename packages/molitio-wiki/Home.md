[Molitio Web Engine](../../README.md)

# Welcome to the Molitio Wiki

## How and why do we use it?

To enhance efficiency and success, it is advisable to establish a framework and document it in a way that is easy to follow and consistent.
  * Primarily for knowledge sharing, with continuous incremental expansion.
  * To document processes and methods, both those yet to be explored and those already tried and tested.
  * For version control and source history, which is useful for ad-hoc tasks.
  * To track time-critical tasks.

## What should you know on this portal?

We record the discussed project concepts, solutions, issues, and milestones in the appropriate places.
  * [Wiki (this page) :)](https://github.com/NestMediaHu/to-be-determined/wiki)

    "Knowledge applied with good intention is wisdom" - the more we document, the more our toolbox expands.
  * [Data repository collection (let's stick with the repository) :), 1 project = 1 repository = 1 concept](https://github.com/orgs/NestMediaHu/repositories)

    Projects and concepts are recorded in separate repositories, along with their related topics.
  * [Issues for bugs/tasks/epics](https://github.com/NestMediaHu/to-be-determined/issues)

    Used to store tasks, bugs, and other operational to-dos.
  * [Solutions](https://github.com/NestMediaHu/to-be-determined/wiki)

    Every repository has a dedicated wiki where we document various project-specific solutions.
  * [Milestones](https://github.com/NestMediaHu/to-be-determined/milestones)

    Milestones reflect the estimated time window and completion status of the associated task collections.

  * Workshop topics
