# Plan: UI Card Component

## Overview
The `Card` component is a reusable UI element for displaying an image, title, and description. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and easily styled. This plan is in lockstep with the current implementation in `ui-core`.

## Goals
- Provide a flexible card for use in various UI contexts.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.
- Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).

## API (Current)
- `CardProps`: `{ data: CardData }`
- `CardData`: `{ title, imageUrl, imageAlt, description }`

## Structure
- Image section (circular, responsive)
- Title (prominent, centered)
- Description (subheading)

## Accessibility (A11y)
- `alt` text is required for images.
- Semantic HTML structure.

## Molitio Contract
- All instances must include a `data-molitio-id="ui-card"` attribute (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various `CardData` props.
- **Interaction:** (Planned) Support for click/hover actions.
- **Accessibility:** Image must have `alt` text; headings must use semantic tags.
- **Molitio Contract:** (Planned) Enforce `data-molitio-id` attribute.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** Card only displays card data.
- **Open/Closed:** Card can be extended with new props or styles without modifying core logic.

## Future Directions
- Add support for actions (buttons, links).
- Add theming and style variants.
- Integrate with design tokens.
- Expand accessibility features.
