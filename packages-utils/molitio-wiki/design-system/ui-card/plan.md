# Plan: UI Card Component

## Overview
The `Card` component is a reusable UI element for displaying an image, title, and description. It is designed to be simple, accessible, and easily styled. This plan will evolve as the component and our design system mature.

## Goals
- Provide a flexible card for use in various UI contexts.
- Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.
- Adhere to Molitio's Four Pillars of Component Testing.
- Follow the 12-Factor App methodology (stateless, configurable, etc.).

## API
- **Props:**
  - `data: CardData` â€” Contains `title`, `imageUrl`, `imageAlt`, and `description`.

## Structure
- Image section (circular, responsive)
- Title (prominent, centered)
- Description (subheading)

## Accessibility (A11y)
- `alt` text is required for images.
- Semantic HTML structure.

## Molitio Contract
- All instances must include a `data-molitio-id="ui-card"` attribute (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:**
  - Renders with various `CardData` props.
- **Interaction:**
  - (Future) Support for click/hover actions.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Image must have `alt` text.
  - Headings must use semantic tags.
- **Molitio Contract:**
  - (Future) Enforce `data-molitio-id` attribute.

## Future Directions
- Add support for actions (buttons, links).
- Add theming and style variants.
- Integrate with design tokens.
- Expand accessibility features.
