# Plan: Layout Component

## Overview
The layout component defines the overall structure of the web application, including header, main content, and footer. It ensures consistency and responsiveness across all pages.

## Goals
- Provide a flexible, reusable structure for all pages (starting with molitio.com landing page).
- Support responsive design for all device sizes.
- Integrate navigation and footer components.

## API (Initial)
- Accepts children (main content), optional header/footer overrides.

## Structure
- Header (navigation)
- Main content area
- Footer

## Accessibility (A11y)
- Semantic HTML (header, main, footer tags).
- Landmarks for screen readers.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="layout"`.

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various children and layouts.
- **Accessibility:** Landmarks and structure pass aXe or similar checks.
- **Molitio Contract:** Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## Future Directions
- Add support for modals, sidebars, and dynamic content regions.
- Theming and layout variants.
