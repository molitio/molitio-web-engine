# Plan: Interaction Component (Deprecated)

This plan is deprecated. Please refer to `ui-interactive/plan.md` for the current interaction component documentation.

## Overview
Interaction components handle user input and feedback, such as buttons, forms, and modals. They are essential for building engaging and accessible web applications.

## Goals
- Provide a set of reusable, accessible interaction primitives.
- Ensure all components are keyboard and screen reader accessible.
- Support for theming and variants.

## API (Initial)
- Button: label, onClick, type, variant.
- Modal: open state, content, onClose.
- Form: children, onSubmit, validation.

## Structure
- Button
- Modal
- Form

## Accessibility (A11y)
- All components must be fully keyboard accessible.
- Proper ARIA roles and labels.

## Molitio Contract
- Each component must include a unique `data-molitio-id` (e.g., `data-molitio-id="button"`).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various props and states.
- **Interaction:** Responds to user input and events.
- **Accessibility:** Passes aXe or similar checks.
- **Molitio Contract:** Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## Future Directions
- Add more interaction primitives (dropdowns, tooltips, etc.).
- Integrate with form validation libraries.
