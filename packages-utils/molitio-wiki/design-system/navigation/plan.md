# Plan: Navigation Component

## Overview
A navigation component provides users with access to the main sections of the application. It must be accessible, responsive, and easy to extend as the site grows.

## Goals
- Enable intuitive navigation for molitio.com and future pages.
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles).
- Support for mobile and desktop layouts.

## API (Initial)
- Accepts a list of navigation items (label, href, optional icon).
- Supports highlighting the active route.

## Structure
- Horizontal bar for desktop, collapsible menu for mobile.
- Logo area, navigation links, and (future) user actions (login, profile).

## Accessibility (A11y)
- Keyboard navigable.
- Proper ARIA roles and labels.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="navigation"`.

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various navigation item sets.
- **Interaction:** Supports keyboard and mouse navigation.
- **Accessibility:** Passes aXe or similar checks.
- **Molitio Contract:** Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## Future Directions
- Add dropdowns, user menus, and theming.
- Integrate with routing and authentication.
