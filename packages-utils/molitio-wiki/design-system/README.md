# Molitio Design System Documentation

This directory contains the plan documents for all reusable UI components in the Molitio Web Engine. Each `plan.md` describes the component's intended functionality and usage for developers and users.

## Documentation Structure
- **Architectural principles and workflow** are defined in the root `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `development-workflow.md`.
- **Component plan docs** (`plan.md`) must only describe the component's functionality and usage. Do not repeat architectural principles here.

## How to Use
- Update the relevant `plan.md` whenever a component changes.
- Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `development-workflow.md` for architectural and workflow guidance.
- Treat these documents as the canonical work contract for all contributors and AI agents.
