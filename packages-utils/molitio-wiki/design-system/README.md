# Molitio Design System Documentation

This directory contains the plan documents for all reusable UI components in the Molitio Web Engine. Each `plan.md` describes the component's intended functionality and usage for developers and users.

## Architectural Principles
- The architectural principles, including the 12-Factor App, SOLID, TDD, and workflow standards, are defined in the root `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `development-workflow.md`.
- Component plans should focus on describing the component's purpose, API, and usageâ€”not repeating architectural principles.

## How to Use
- Update the relevant `plan.md` whenever a component changes.
- Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `development-workflow.md` for architectural and workflow guidance.
