# Plan: UI Contact Form Component

## Overview
The `ContactForm` component is a placeholder for a user contact form. This plan is in lockstep with the current implementation in `ui-core`.

## Goals
- Provide a form for user contact or feedback.
- Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).

## API (Current)
- No props (future: form fields, handlers).

## Structure
- (Planned) Form fields for user input.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- (Planned) Semantic form elements and labels.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-contact-form"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders form container.
- **Interaction:** (Planned) Submits and validates input.
- **Accessibility:** (Planned) Semantic HTML and labels.
- **Molitio Contract:** (Planned) Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** ContactForm only handles contact form logic.
- **Open/Closed:** Can be extended with new fields or validation without modifying core logic.

## Future Directions
- Implement form fields and validation.
- Add accessibility features.
