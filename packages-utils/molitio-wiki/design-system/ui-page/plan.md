# Plan: UI Page Section Component

## Overview
The `PageSection` component provides a reusable section wrapper for page content. This plan is in lockstep with the current implementation in `ui-core`.

## Goals
- Provide a consistent section layout for pages.
- Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).

## API (Current)
- Accepts `children` for section content.

## Structure
- `<section>` with a centered container for content.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- Semantic `<section>` element.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-page-section"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various children.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML.
- **Molitio Contract:** (Planned) Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** PageSection only handles section layout.
- **Open/Closed:** Can be extended with new props or styles without modifying core logic.

## Future Directions
- Add support for section variants (hero, info, etc.).
- Add accessibility features.
