# Plan: UI Image Section Component

## Overview
The `ImageSection` component displays a full-width image. This plan is in lockstep with the current implementation in `ui-core`.

## Goals
- Display a prominent image section.
- Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).

## API (Current)
- `ImageSectionData`: `{ imageUrl, imageAlt }`

## Structure
- `<div>` containing an `<img>` with full width and height.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- `alt` text is required for images.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-image-section"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders with various images.
- **Accessibility:** Image must have `alt` text.
- **Molitio Contract:** (Planned) Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** ImageSection only displays an image.
- **Open/Closed:** Can be extended with new props or styles without modifying core logic.

## Future Directions
- Add overlays, captions, or interactive elements.
- Expand accessibility features.
