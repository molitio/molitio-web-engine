# Plan: UI Gallery Tool Component

## Overview
The `GalleryToolContainer` component provides a container for gallery display. This plan is in lockstep with the current implementation in `ui-core`.

## Goals
- Display a gallery of images or items.
- Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed).

## API (Current)
- No props (future: gallery items, handlers).

## Structure
- `<div>` container for gallery content.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- (Planned) Semantic roles and keyboard navigation.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-gallery-tool"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Testing Plan
- **Rendering:** Renders gallery container.
- **Accessibility:** (Planned) Semantic roles.
- **Molitio Contract:** (Planned) Enforces `data-molitio-id`.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** GalleryTool only handles gallery display.
- **Open/Closed:** Can be extended with new props or styles without modifying core logic.

## Future Directions
- Add gallery items and controls.
- Add accessibility features.
