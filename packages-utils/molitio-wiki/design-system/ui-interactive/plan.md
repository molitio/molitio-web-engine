# Plan: UI Interactive Components

## Overview
The UI Interactive components provide reusable primitives for user interaction, starting with the Button.

## API
- `ButtonProps`: `{ children, ... }` (see implementation for details)

## Usage
- Use for primary actions in the UI.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- Button is a native `<button>` element.

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-button"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Future Directions
- Add more interaction primitives (modals, forms, dropdowns, etc.).
- Add theming and style variants.
- Expand accessibility features.
