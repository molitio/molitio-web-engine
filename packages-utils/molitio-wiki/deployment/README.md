# Deployment Strategy

This section outlines the deployment strategies for the Molitio Web Engine components, focusing on the Resource Hub API. We cover both local development setups using Docker Compose and production deployment strategies targeting AWS Kubernetes (EKS).

Our goal is to provide a clear, maintainable, and scalable approach to deploying and managing our applications.

## Documentation Structure

- **[Local Development with Docker Compose](./LocalDevelopmentDockerCompose.md)**: Detailed guide on setting up and running the Resource Hub and related services locally using Docker Compose.
- **[Production Deployment on AWS EKS](./ProductionAWSEKS.md)**: Overview of the strategy for deploying the Resource Hub to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

This documentation serves as a baseline and will be updated as our infrastructure evolves.
