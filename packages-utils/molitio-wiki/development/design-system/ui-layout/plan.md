# Plan: UI Layout Component

## Overview
The `MWERootLayout` component defines the overall structure of the web application, including the navigation bar, main content, and global providers.

## API
- `RootLayoutProps`: `{ appContext: AppContext }`
- Accepts `children` for main content.

## Usage
- Use as the root layout for all pages. Integrates navigation and context providers.

## Accessibility (A11y)
- Semantic HTML structure (`<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.).

## Molitio Contract
- Must include `data-molitio-id="ui-layout"` (to be added in future iterations).

## Future Directions
- Add support for modals, sidebars, and dynamic content regions.
- Theming and layout variants.
